# Algorithms Simulator
The project on operating system course was about creating a program that simulate different kind of scheduling algorithms for entered processes.

# Scheduling Algorithms
* First Come First Serve (FCFS) Algorithm
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Algorithm
* Priority Algorithm

Also a GANTT CHART will be generated for entered processes.
